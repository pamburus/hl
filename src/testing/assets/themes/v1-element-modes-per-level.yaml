# V1 test theme for verifying element modes are preserved after per-level merge
#
# This theme tests the scenario where:
# - An element (level-inner) defines modes = ["bold"]
# - Per-level styles (levels.info.level-inner) define style references
# - After merging, the bold mode should be preserved
#
# The merge flow being tested:
# 1. Theme merge: @base + this theme → level-inner = { modes = ["bold"] } replaces @base's
# 2. Per-level merge: elements.level-inner + levels.info.level-inner → property-level merge
#    Result: level-inner = { style = ["level", "info"], modes = ["bold"] }
# 3. Resolution: The final rendered style should have bold mode
