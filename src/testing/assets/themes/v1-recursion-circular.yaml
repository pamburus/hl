# Test theme for circular role reference detection (FR-047)
#
# This theme contains a circular inheritance chain:
#   primary → secondary → primary
#
# When resolving the `level` element (which references `primary`),
# the resolver will detect that the chain exceeds the recursion limit
# of 64 levels and fail with StyleRecursionLimitExceeded error.
#
# Expected behavior:
# - Theme loading should fail with Error::FailedToResolveTheme
# - Inner error should be ThemeLoadError::StyleRecursionLimitExceeded
# - Error should include theme name "v1-recursion-circular"
# - Error should indicate which role exceeded the limit (primary or secondary)
