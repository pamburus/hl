# V0 theme to test automatic style deduction
# Elements are defined with colors/modes but no style references
# The system should automatically deduce appropriate style references

elements:
  # String with foreground - should auto-add style = "primary"
  string:
    foreground: 'green'

  # Time with foreground - should auto-add style = "secondary"
  time:
    foreground: 'bright-black'

  # Message with foreground and modes - should auto-add style = "strong"
  message:
    foreground: 'white'
    modes: ['italic']

  # Key with foreground - should auto-add style = "accent"
  key:
    foreground: 'yellow'

  # Level with foreground - no auto style deduction for this one
  level:
    foreground: 'blue'
