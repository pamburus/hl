# V0 theme to test regression where defined elements should NOT inherit styles
# This represents a typical v0 theme where elements are defined with only foreground
# These elements should be rendered EXACTLY as defined, without inheriting modes from @base

elements:
  # Time with only foreground - should NOT get faint mode from @base's secondary style
  time:
    foreground: 30

  # Message with only foreground - should NOT get bold mode from @base's strong/message style
  message:
    foreground: 195

  # Key with only foreground - should NOT get faint mode from @base's accent style
  key:
    foreground: 220

  # String with only foreground - should NOT get any modes from @base's primary style
  string:
    foreground: 120

  # Level with foreground - should render as-is
  level:
    foreground: "blue"
