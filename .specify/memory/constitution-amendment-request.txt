Add new principle VII: Test Data Management

Tests MUST use external data files instead of inline multiline string literals for themes, configs, and other structured data.

Rationale:
- Inline strings make tests harder to read and maintain
- External files can be validated with proper tooling (YAML/TOML linters)
- Embedded resources at compile time provide same performance as inline strings
- Easier to reuse test data across multiple tests
- Better separation of test logic from test data

Requirements:
- Theme and config test data MUST be stored in dedicated test asset directories (e.g., src/testing/assets/themes/)
- Test files SHOULD use the same format as production files (YAML, TOML, JSON)
- Tests MAY embed external files at compile time using include_str! or similar if needed
- Inline strings are acceptable ONLY for very short values (<3 lines) or when the string content itself is what's being tested
